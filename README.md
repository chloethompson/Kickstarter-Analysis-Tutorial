![Headers](images/header.png "Header")

This repo has been created to hold the materials for the AI NI Datathon, Introduction to Data Science Workshop. 

The workshop will take you through how to:

1. Load datasets
2. Visualise your data
3. Split the data for model training
4. Train and evaluate a K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm

# Getting Started

### Files

During the session we will take you over the powerpoint for some KNN theory fundamentals first. 

After that we will be walking through the code live using the Kickstarter Analysis - Tutorial.ipynb notebook. 

The empty notebook - Kickstarter Analysis - Empty.ipynb - is yours to code in and follow allow with the instructors. If you get stuck we're here to help debug!

### Installing

The notebook has all the imports for the code in the first cell of both  Kickstarter Analysis - Empty.ipynb and Kickstarter Analysis - Tutorial.ipynb

### Dataset

You can use the one in the repo or download the latest from Kaggle:
